Accidents are more common on days 1, 6, and 7 (presumably the three weekend days). Day 7 has almost 1000 more accidents than day 3. Similar, accidents are more likely to occur during the evening, peaking at 18:00-19:00. The time with the least accidents is early morning, from 4:00-5:00. There is a brief peak at 6:00-7:00 as people go to work, it drops in the early morning, then climbs to the evening.

```{r}
acc$DRUNK_DR<- as.numeric(acc$DRUNK_DR)
atleast1 <- acc %>%
  filter(DRUNK_DR >= 1)
nrow(atleast1)
```

There are 8720 accidents with at least one drunk driver.

```{r}
person <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yumouqiu/DS202-Spring2023/main/Practice/data/fars2016/person.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
drivers <- person %>%
  filter(PER_TYP == 1)
accident_with_drivers <- acc %>%
  inner_join(drivers, by = "ST_CASE")
```


```{r}
accidents_by_day_hour_gender <- accident_with_drivers %>%
  group_by(DAY_WEEK, HOUR.x, SEX) %>%
  summarize(n = n())

accidents_by_day_hour_gender <- accidents_by_day_hour_gender %>% filter(HOUR.x <30)

```

```{r}
#making SEX into a factor so it separates out each line by gender--the graph was weird, nearly unreadable without doing this
accidents_by_day_hour_gender <- accidents_by_day_hour_gender %>% mutate(SEX = as.factor(SEX))
```


```{r}

ggplot(accidents_by_day_hour_gender, aes(x = HOUR.x, y = n, color = SEX)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~DAY_WEEK, ncol = 3) +
